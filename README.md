  In this project, I designed a system for DriverPass, a company that wants to help people prepare more effectively for their DMV driving tests. They needed a system that would let customers take online classes, schedule driving lessons, track their progress, and manage their accounts. Staff members also needed tools to handle appointments, update customer information, and keep training materials current. The overall goal was to create a system that makes learning easier for customers and daily operations smoother for employees.

  One thing I feel I did particularly well was organizing the system requirements and diagrams in a way that made the whole design easy to understand. I focused on clarity and structure, which helped me communicate how the system should work for both customers and staff. If I were to revise one part of my work, I would probably refine the Entity‑Relationship Diagram. Although it covers all the necessary components, I think I could improve the layout and relationships to make it even more readable and intuitive.

  When interpreting the user’s needs, I tried to think about the real experience of someone preparing for a driving test. That meant focusing on convenience, clear navigation, and reliable access to lessons and scheduling tools. I also considered what staff members need behind the scenes, such as secure data handling and easy account management. Understanding user needs is essential because a system only succeeds if it actually solves the problems people face. Good design starts with empathy and ends with functionality that feels natural to the user.

  My approach to designing software usually begins with gathering requirements and breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces. I like to use diagrams, such as activity diagrams and ERDs, because they help me visualize how the system behaves and how data flows between different parts. In the future, I plan to continue using techniques like user stories, iterative refinement, and clear documentation. These strategies help ensure that the final design is both technically sound and aligned with what users actually need.
